\subsection{Kosten- Nutzen Verhältnis}
%TODO Herausforderungen: auf  Brain Shift, Aortenaneurysma, Tumorentfernung und Herzchirurgie Todesrate wieder drauf eingehen wenn möglich


%The tumors were microscopically completely removed in 14 out of 16 cases. Thus, iMR image
%data compensate for the effects of brain shift with a high degree of accuracy. Updating the neuronavigation system
%with intraoperative MR images seems to be the most reliable way to compensate for intraoperative brain shift
%\cite{BrainShiftInTumorResection}

%These high-tech rooms
%cost approximately double the investment and maintenance
%of conventional operating rooms and are 90%
%more costly than a cardiac cath lab mainly because of
%higher space and equipment requirements. \cite{ORofTheFuture}

%It is anticipated that with the creation of a super subspecialty,
%cardiovascular hybrid surgery, many of these hybrid
%procedures could be done without the need for collaboration
%of specialists from various medical fields, as is
%the current practice. \cite{ORofTheFuture}
